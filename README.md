A GitHub action for installing [fish shell](https://fishshell.com) plugins.

<hr>

## Prerequisites

This action requires the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com). You can install it using the [fish-shop/install-fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shop/install-fish-shell) action.

## Usage

Add a suitable `uses` step to your GitHub [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) and specify the plugin manager and plugin(s) to be installed by providing values for the `plugin-manager` and `plugins` inputs respectively:

```yaml
jobs:
  install-plugin:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install Pond plugin with Fisher
        uses: fish-shop/install-plugin@v2
        with:
          plugin-manager: fisher
          plugins: marcransome/pond
```

> [!TIP]
> The `plugins` input supports multiple space-separated plugin names/URLs. The exact format is dependent upon the plugin manager being used and you should refer to the plugin manager's documentation for additional information (see [Supported plugin managers](#supported-plugin-managers)).

> [!NOTE]
> For additional safety, the inputs `plugin-manager` and `plugins` are handled internally using intermediary environment variables and escaped to mitigate the risk of [script injections](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#understanding-the-risk-of-script-injections).

The plugin manager will be installed only if not already present. If your workflow job contains multiple `install-plugin` actions that use the same plugin manager then only the first action will install the plugin manager.

If you wish to install a plugin manager in isolation, without installing any plugins at the same time, consider using the [fish-shop/install-plugin-manager](https://github.com/fish-shop/install-plugin-manager) action instead.

## Supported plugin managers

The following table lists the supported plugin managers and the corresponding `plugin-manager` input value to use in your workflow:

| Plugin manager                                         | `plugin-manager` value |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)       | `fisher`               |
| [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) | `oh-my-fish`           |
| ~~[plug.fish](https://github.com/kidonng/plug.fish)~~  | ~~`plug.fish`~~[^1]    |

[^1]: `plug.fish` support was removed in `v2.0.0` due to functional changes made in recent versions of this plugin manager.

## Action versions

Use one of the following patterns when specifying the version reference for this action in your workflow (i.e. the `{ref}` value in `uses: fish-shop/install-plugin@{ref}`):

| Pattern  | Example   | Description                                                            |
|----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vX`     | `v2`      | the latest `v2.*` release including non-breaking changes and bug fixes |
| `vX.Y`   | `v2.1`    | the latest `v2.1.*` release including bug fixes                        |
| `vX.Y.Z` | `v2.1.0`  | the `v2.1.0` release only                                              |

> [!TIP]
> The recommended pattern is `vX` (e.g. `v2`). This will ensure that the version of the action used in your workflow includes the latest non-breaking changes and bug fixes, and guarantees compatibility with previous versions of that major release number.

Using a `main` branch reference in your workflow is _not_ recommended as this branch may include breaking changes intended for the next major release.
